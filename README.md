2 types of mappings:
- When an external entity is removed by Slimmer because it is redundant from another source (which should be a 1 to 1 mapping) ([related issue](https://github.com/enanomapper/ontologies/issues/471))
- Mappings from internal and external module entities to other ontologies (OBO, CHEBI, CHEMINF...)
